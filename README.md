# TicTacToe
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in JavaScript.

This project utilizes the following techniques and methods:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The game logic is organized into objects like GameBoard, Player, and GameMaster to enhance code modularity and reusability.
- **DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript is employed to dynamically update the game board and display game results.
- **Event Handling:** Event listeners are used to detect user interactions, such as clicking on a game board cell or the restart button.
- **Game Logic:** The core game logic, including win/lose/tie conditions and turn-based gameplay, is implemented using conditional statements and loops.
- **User Interface:** HTML and CSS are used to create a user-friendly interface with clear visual elements.
